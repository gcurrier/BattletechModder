# Battletech Editor
A Java-based (JavaFX) dektop utility to modify configuration files used in Battletech (from Harebrained Schemes) cobbled together from various ideas I found around the web.
This current branch is a fork of the [Battletech Weapon Editor](https://github.com/iRhuel/BattleTechWeaponEditor) with some heavy modifications planned. I liked the way it was structured and will be adding quite a few modifications to it in the future.
