# BattletechModder
Desktop tool written in Java, using JavaFX to make modifying Battletech configuration files easier and more controlled, preventing accidental breaking of the Mulitplayer mode.

## NOTE
The current build is for preliminary GUI evaluation. It's just a template GUI - a preliminary design and is subject to change.

# Installation
Installer is located under build -> deploy -> bundles -> BattletechModder-0.1a.exe
For those of you feeling more hands-on, the jar file is also included:  build -> dist -> BattletechModder.jar. You will need jAva version 1.8.0_172 installed to run it. Open a command prompt or Powershell window and...
```
java -jar BattletechModder.jar
```

## Location
The app installs to (windows) C:\Users\userName\AppData\Local\BattletechModder. THere, you will find the BattletechModder.exe file, for which a shortcut may be made and placed on the desktop.
